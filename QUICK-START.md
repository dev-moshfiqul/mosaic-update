# 🚀 Mystery Mosaic - Quick Start Guide

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - No Server Required!**

Since you're getting "Network error", I've created a **local version** that works without any server setup:

### **Step 1: Open the Local Test Version**
1. Open `test-local.html` in your browser
2. This works immediately - no server needed!

### **Step 2: Test the Full App**
1. After signing up in `test-local.html`, it will redirect to `app-local.html`
2. This is the complete mosaic creator with demo tracking
